## **Project Status & Next Steps (as of now)**

### **Backend**
- **Product API**
  - Pagination, filtering, sorting, and search are implemented on `/product`.
  - Stats endpoint `/product/stats` is available.
  - Category API is robust and image cleanup is handled.

### **Frontend**
- **API Layer**
  - `productApi` module is created and supports all needed operations.
- **Context/Hook**
  - Product context and hook are the next step (**not yet implemented**).
- **Components**
  - StatCard component is available and ready for use.
  - Product admin page (`Products.jsx`) is a placeholder.
  - Category CRUD flow is complete and serves as a reference for product CRUD.

## **What’s Next?**

1. **Implement Product Context**
    - State: products, pagination, filters, stats, loading, error, etc.
    - Methods: fetchProducts, fetchStats, createProduct, updateProduct, deleteProduct, setFilters, setPage, etc.
2. **Custom Hook**
    - For easy access to context in components.
3. **Product Components**
    - StatCard section for product stats.
    - Paginated product table with CRUD actions.
    - Add/Edit/Delete modals.
    - Pagination controls.
4. **Integrate into `Products.jsx`**
    - Use context, hook, and components to build the admin product page.
